### A Moderation Utility to make moderation easier.
This is the main source code repository for Unix. It contains the source code for the Unix Discord Bot, as well as the eventual documentation


#### Notes
- The Unix Discord bot relies on the [Disqord](https://github.com/Quahu/Disqord) wrapper to interact with the Discord API.
- Building from the repository is not officially supported or recommended. If you want to use the Unix Discord bot for your server, Feel free to request access on our [Discord!](https://discord.gg/6yMXWUWANW)
